## Experiment No. 3
## Title: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
________________________________________
## Aim:

To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot must be capable of efficiently handling various customer queries while maintaining a user-friendly and conversational tone. This experiment employs a range of prompting patterns to guide the development and training of the chatbot—from simple, task-specific prompts to more sophisticated persona-driven interactions.
________________________________________
## Requirements:

•	GPT-based AI platform (such as OpenAI’s GPT models)
•	Scenario-based datasets for chatbot interactions
•	Prompt templates using various prompting techniques
•	Evaluation framework to assess chatbot performance
________________________________________
## Theory:

Prompting techniques are strategies used to elicit specific responses from language models like GPT. These prompts act as inputs to guide the behavior and language of the model, helping it generate more accurate, relevant, or engaging outputs. By applying structured prompting methods, developers can customize the chatbot’s responses across different contexts and user needs.

Prompting techniques explored in this experiment include:
1.	Direct Instruction Prompts
2.	Contextual Prompting
3.	Persona-Based Prompting
4.	Few-Shot Prompting

## Algorithm & Procedure:
## 1. Direct Instruction Prompts

Objective: Enable the chatbot to deliver concise, direct answers.
Description: The model is given specific phrasing to use in its responses.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with: ‘Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].’”
Use Case: Suitable for frequently asked questions or straightforward service updates.

## 2. Contextual Prompting

Objective: Enable the chatbot to use previous user inputs to formulate relevant responses.
Description: The chatbot considers earlier conversation history for better personalization.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“If the customer previously mentioned they haven’t received their order, say: ‘I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.’”
Use Case: Useful in multi-turn conversations or complaint tracking.

## 3. Persona-Based Prompting

Objective: Make chatbot communication more engaging by giving it a human-like persona.
Description: The model is instructed to take on the role of a friendly support agent.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as: ‘Hey there! I’m here to help with any questions you might have. Let’s get your issue sorted!’”
Use Case: Enhances user experience and builds rapport with users.

## 4. Few-Shot Prompting

Objective: Teach the model to generalize responses using a few example inputs and outputs.
Description: Multiple examples are provided to help the model infer patterns.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“My phone isn’t charging.” → “Have you tried using a different cable?”
“The screen is flickering.” → “Try restarting the device.”
Now respond to: “My app keeps crashing.”
Expected Output: “Try reinstalling the app. If the issue continues, check for updates or contact support.”
Use Case: Ideal for technical support and diagnostics.

## 5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Objective: Use logical, step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.
Description: Break down responses into steps to ensure clarity and correctness.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“When a customer reports their laptop overheating:
•	Ask if they’re using it on a soft surface.
•	Suggest using a hard surface for better ventilation.
•	Ask if the vents are clean.
•	Recommend restarting.
Now solve: ‘My laptop fan is making a loud noise.’”
Expected Output: “Is your laptop on a soft surface like a bed or pillow? That can restrict airflow. Try moving it to a flat, hard surface. Also, dust buildup in the fan vents can cause noise—cleaning them might help. Restarting may also reset fan speed.”
Use Case: Suitable for detailed troubleshooting scenarios.

## 6. Instruction with Constraints

Objective: Guide the model to follow rules regarding length, tone, or content.
Description: Constraints are embedded in the prompt to control output style.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon. Example: ‘Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.’”
Use Case: Ideal for SMS replies or app-based customer chat where brevity is important.
________________________________________

## 7.Reflective Prompting

Objective: Reduce misunderstandings by confirming the user’s query before answering.
Description: The chatbot first repeats the user’s request to clarify.
Prompt Pattern Example:
“When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back. For example: ‘You’re asking how to reset your password, correct? Here’s how you can do it…’”
Use Case: Useful in sensitive or technical issues where confirmation is important.

## Results:

Each prompting strategy was tested with relevant sample queries. The chatbot responses were evaluated based on accuracy, tone, relevance, and user engagement.
Prompting Type	Clarity	Contextual Accuracy	Engagement	Use Case Efficiency
Direct Instruction	High	Moderate	Low	High
Contextual Prompting	High	High	Moderate	High
Persona-Based Prompting	Moderate	Moderate	High	High
Few-Shot Prompting	High	High	Moderate	High
Chain-of-Thought	High	High	Moderate	High
Instruction with Constraints	High	Moderate	Moderate	High
Reflective Prompting	High	High	Moderate	High
All prompting techniques functioned successfully, producing contextually relevant, appropriately toned, and structured responses in alignment with the experiment’s objective.

## Conclusion:

The experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of scenario-based prompt engineering in designing intelligent, context-aware customer service chatbots. Each prompting style contributes uniquely:
•	Direct instruction ensures standardization.
•	Contextual prompting provides personalization.
•	Persona-based prompting increases engagement.
•	Few-shot and chain-of-thought techniques help handle complex queries.
•	Constraints and reflective prompting enforce clarity and conciseness.
By integrating these techniques, a highly functional and human-like chatbot can be developed, capable of serving in various customer service environments effectively.
